  abstract = {Microscopic simulation models are becoming increasingly important tools in modeling transport systems. There is a large number of models used in many countries. The most difficult stage in the development and use of such models is the calibration and validation of the microscopic sub-models such as the car following and gap acceptance models. This difficulty is due to the lack of suitable methods for adapting models to empirical data. The aim of this paper is to present recent progress in calibrating a number of microscopic traffic flow models. Ten very different models have been tested using data collected via DGPS-equipped cars (Differential Global Positioning System) on a test track in Japan. To calibrate the models, the data of the leading car are fed into the model under consideration and the model is used to compute the headway time series of the following car. The deviations between the measured and the simulated headways are then used to calibrate and validate the models. The calibration results agree with earlier studies as there are errors of 12 \% to 17\% for all models and no model can be denoted to be the best. The differences between individual drivers are larger than the differences between different models. The validation process gives acceptable errors from 17 \% to 22\%. But for special data sets with validation errors up to 60\% the calibration process has reached what is known as ``overfitting'': because of the adaptation to a particular situation, the models are not capable of generalizing to other situations.},

  abstract = {Transportation systems are becoming increasingly complex with the evolution of emerging technologies, including deeper connectivity and automation, which will require more advanced control mechanisms for efficient operation (in terms of energy, mobility, and productivity). Stakeholders, including government agencies, industry, and local populations, all have an interest in efficient outcomes, yet there are few tools for developing a holistic understanding of urban dynamics. Simulating large-scale, high-fidelity transportation systems can help, but remains a challenging task, due to the computational demand of processing massive numbers of events and the nonlinear interactions between system components and traveling agents. In this paper, we introduce Mobiliti, a proof-of-concept, scalable transportation system simulator that implements parallel discrete event simulation on high-performance computers. We instantiated millions of nodes, links, and agents to simulate the movement of the population through the San Francisco Bay Area road network and provide estimates of the associated congestion, energy usage, and productivity loss. Our preliminary results show excellent scalability on multiple compute nodes for statically-routed agents, simulating 9.5 million trip legs over a road network with 1.1 million nodes and 2.2 million links, processing 2.4 billion events in less than 30 seconds using 1,024 cores on NERSC's Cori computer.},

This publication briefly describes the simulation package together with the projects mentioned above to show how SUMO can be used to simulate largescale traffic scenarios.

While some traffic simulation methods have appeared in computer graphics, most related systems focus on the design of buildings, roads, or cities but without explicitly considering urban traffic. To our knowledge, our work provides the first interactive approach which enables a designer to specify a desired vehicular traffic behavior (e.g., road occupancy, travel time, emissions, etc.) and the system will automatically compute what realistic 3D urban model (e.g., an interconnected network of roads, parcels, and buildings) yields the specified behavior. Our system both altered and improved traffic behavior in novel procedurally-generated cities and in road networks of existing cities. Our urban models contain up to 360 km of roads, 300,000 vehicles, and typically cover four hours of simulated peak traffic time. The typical editing session time to "paint" a new traffic pattern and to compute the new/changed urban model is two to five minutes.},

The application of the methodology on an arterial site and the comparison with field data show that it consistently identifies spillovers in urban networks with signal-controlled intersections. The method is extended to account for the variations in vehicle lengths. We also investigate the significant effect of spillovers in congestion and show that a macroscopic diagram that connects spillovers with vehicle density exists in large-scale congested urban networks.},

  abstract = {The MATSim (Multi-Agent Transport Simulation) software project was started around 2006 with the goal of generating traffic and congestion patterns by following individual synthetic travelers through their daily or weekly activity programme. It has since then evolved from a collection of stand-alone C++ programs to an integrated Java-based framework which is publicly hosted, open-source available, automatically regression tested. It is currently used by about 40 groups throughout the world. This book takes stock of the current status.The first part of the book gives an introduction to the most important concepts, with the intention of enabling a potential user to set up and run basic simulations.The second part of the book describes how the basic functionality can be extended, for example by adding schedule-based public transit, electric or autonomous cars, paratransit, or within-day replanning. For each extension, the text provides pointers to the additional documentation and to the code base. It is also discussed how people with appropriate Java programming skills can write their own extensions, and plug them into the MATSim core.The project has started from the basic idea that traffic is a consequence of human behavior, and thus humans and their behavior should be the starting point of all modelling, and with the intuition that when simulations with 100 million particles are possible in computational physics, then behavior-oriented simulations with 10 million travelers should be possible in travel behavior research. The initial implementations thus combined concepts from computational physics and complex adaptive systems with concepts from travel behavior research. The third part of the book looks at theoretical concepts that are able to describe important aspects of the simulation system; for example, under certain conditions the code becomes a Monte Carlo engine sampling from a discrete choice model. Another important aspect is the interpretation of the MATSim score as utility in the microeconomic sense, opening up a connection to benefit cost analysis.Finally, the book collects use cases as they have been undertaken with MATSim. All current users of MATSim were invited to submit their work, and many followed with sometimes crisp and short and sometimes longer contributions, always with pointers to additional references.We hope that the book will become an invitation to explore, to build and to extend agent-based modeling of travel behavior from the stable and well tested core of MATSim documented here.},

CDR, which consist of time stamped tower locations with caller IDs, are analyzed first and trips occurring within certain time windows are used to generate tower-to-tower transient OD matrices for different time periods. These are then associated with corresponding nodes of the traffic network and converted to node-to-node transient OD matrices. The actual OD matrices are derived by scaling up these node-to-node transient OD matrices. An optimization based approach, in conjunction with a microscopic traffic simulation platform, is used to determine the scaling factors that result best matches with the observed traffic counts. The methodology is demonstrated using CDR from 2.87 million users of Dhaka, Bangladesh over a month and traffic counts from 13 key locations over 3days of that month. The applicability of the methodology is supported by a validation study.},

The former deal with households that make certain decisions which lead to transportation and the use of infrastructure, as opposed to the latter which explicitly describe the physical propagation of traffic flows in a road network. Our goal is not to give a full account (as that would be a dissertation of its own, given the broadness of the field), but rather to impose upon the reader a thorough feeling for the differences between transportation planning and traffic flow models. Because of the high course of progress over the last decade (or even during the last five years), this paper tries to chronicle both past models, as well as some of the latest developments in this area.},

Traditionally, the data available for traffic simulations come from a population census and dedicated road surveys which only partly cover shopping, leisure or recreational trips. To account for the latter, the presented traffic modelling framework exploits the digital footprints of city inhabitants on services such as Twitter and Foursquare. We enriched the model with findings from our previous studies on geographical layout of communities in a country-wide mobile phone network to account for socially related journeys. These datasets were used to calibrate a variant of a radiation model of spatial choice, which we introduced in order to drive individuals' decisions on trip destinations within an assigned daily activity plan. We observed that given the distribution of population, the workplace locations, a comprehensive set of urban facilities and a list of typical activity sequences of city dwellers collected within a national road survey, the developed micro-simulation reproduces not only the journey statistics but also the traffic volumes at main road segments with surprising accuracy.},

Although there are major types, there are so many hybrids that it is difficult to classify them all. The standard way of assigning traffic to a network is to find a static equilibrium from which no driver would be able to find a quicker route. This gives fairly good predictions of the link flows resulting from driver choices. Traffic is loaded on to shortest routes, times are modified by a speed-flow function, leading to reassignment to more routes, and the solution is iterated until all used routes between each origin-destination pair take equal time.},

  abstract = {T he relationships among land use, transportation, and the environ-ment are at the heart of growth management. The emerging concern that construction of new suburban highways induces additional travel, vehicle emissions, and land development, making it implausible to " build our way out " of congestion, has reshaped the policy context for met-ropolitan transportation planning (Downs, 1992). Recognizing the effects of transportation on land use and the environment, the Clean Air Act Amend-ments of 1990 and the 1991 Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA; 1991) mandated that metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) integrate metropolitan land use and transportation planning. These legislative actions have led to subsequent legal challenges to the traditional approach to transportation planning that ignores these feedback effects (Garret \& Wachs, 1996). The passage of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21; 1998) in 1998, as the successor to ISTEA, soft-ened these planning requirements somewhat, but significant pressure re-mains to better coordinate metropolitan planning of land use, transporta-tion, and the environment. Requirements for improved and better integrated land use and trans-portation models have emerged, not only in response to this federal legisla-tion but also from state growth management programs that promote closer linkage of land use and transportation planning. Pressure for change has also come from the community of practicing and academic planners and from advocates for the environment and alternative modes of transporta-tion who have become frustrated with the state of the practice, as exemplified in the Portland (OR) LUTRAQ project (Blizzard, 1996). In response to the growing concern regarding the limitations of current land use and trans-portation models, the Travel Model Improvement Project (TMIP) was formed as a collaborative effort by the Federal Highway Administration, the Federal Transit Administration, and the Environmental Protection Agency. In 1995, TMIP hosted an international conference on land use modeling to convene practitioners, researchers, and consultants to assess the state of APA Journal N Summer 2002 N Vol. 68, No. 3 297 Metropolitan areas have come under intense pressure to respond to federal mandates to link planning of land use, transportation, and environmental quality; and from citizen concerns about managing the side effects of growth such as sprawl, congestion, housing affordability, and loss of open space. The planning models used by metropolitan planning organizations were generally not designed to address these issues, creating a gap in the abil-ity of planners to systematically assess them. UrbanSim is a new model sys-tem that was developed to respond to these emerging requirements and has now been applied in three metropoli-tan areas. This article describes the model system and its application to Eugene-Springfield, Oregon.},

In the recent years survey methods are using technologies which provides mobility information with a much higher spatial resolution (e.g. GPS tracking). Therefore, the need to model travel demand on detailed navigation networks rises, which slows down simulation speed significantly. This paper presents methods to increase the performance of the micro simulation model of MATSim using event driven concepts as well as a parallel implementation. The performance experiments with navigation networks of Switzerland containing up to one million roads and 7.3 million agents clearly show that large-scale, multi-agent micro-simulation can also be applied on high resolution networks.},

  abstract = {A MIcroscopic Traffic SIMulator (MITSIM) has been developed for modeling traffic networks with advanced traffic control, route guidance and surveillance systems. MITSIM represents networks in detail and simulates individual vehicle movements using car following, lane changing, and traffic signal responding logic. A probabilistic route choice model is used to capture drivers' route choice decisions in the presence of real time traffic information provided by route guidance systems. The simulator is a component of a larger system for evaluating traffic management systems and interacts with a surveillance module that can represent a wide variety of sensors (e.g. loop detectors, area sensors, probe vehicles, etc.) and a traffic management module which sets traffic signals and signs, routing recommendations, etc. MITSIM is coded in C+ + using object-oriented design and supports distributed implementation. It includes a graphical user interface for animating vehicle movements in the network and displaying aggregate traffic information such as speed and density.},

  abstract = {Traffic signal control is an emerging application scenario for reinforcement learning. Besides being as an important problem that affects people's daily life in commuting, traffic signal control poses its unique challenges for reinforcement learning in terms of adapting to dynamic traffic environment and coordinating thousands of agents including vehicles and pedestrians. A key factor in the success of modern reinforcement learning relies on a good simulator to generate a large number of data samples for learning. The most commonly used open-source traffic simulator SUMO is, however, not scalable to large road network and large traffic flow, which hinders the study of reinforcement learning on traffic scenarios. This motivates us to create a new traffic simulator CityFlow with fundamentally optimized data structures and efficient algorithms. CityFlow can support flexible definitions for road network and traffic flow based on synthetic and real-world data. It also provides user-friendly interface for reinforcement learning. Most importantly, CityFlow is more than twenty times faster than SUMO and is capable of supporting city-wide traffic simulation with an interactive render for monitoring. Besides traffic signal control, CityFlow could serve as the base for other transportation studies and can create new possibilities to test machine learning methods in the intelligent transportation domain.},
